## üì± EdWeiss Application
This is the main Android and iOS EdWeiss app, we are using React Native with Expo benefiting its massive ecosystem of libraries and utilities.

To start the application, install the Expo development build on [Expo website](https://www.expo.dev/) then run one of the "Start application" VSCode tasks (or alternatively, use `npx expo start` directly in the `edweiss-app` folder).

## üî• EdWeiss Firebase
This is the EdWeiss backend, using Google's Firebase cloud infrastructure. We use Cloud Functions for all our sensitive business logic (basically any write to the database) for security and planning reasons.

To deploy the functions to the Cloud, run the "Deploy functions" VSCode task (or alternatively, use `firebase deploy --only functions` directly in the `edweiss-functions` folder).

## üßä EdWeiss Model
This represents all the core types and functions of the app, any changes to this folder should be updated using the "Update model" task.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended VSCode extensions
`ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets` to quickly generate React Native code snippet (use `rnfe`).

`Expo Tools` to get intellisense for Expo config.

`Git Graph` to view the branches and commit history.

`Git Lens` to have better Git implementation (see who modified each line).

`Jest` to be able to run tests from each file more easily.

Also, please turn on VSCode formatting !

## üìã Branch Naming Conventions

- _**feature**/feature-name_  :  This type of commit indicates the addition of a new feature to the code. It can be a major or minor new feature.
  
- _**bugfix**/issue-number_  :  Used when a bug fix is made. It solves an existing problem in the code.
  
- _**documentation**/documented-feature-name_  :  This type is used for documentation-related changes. It does not involve changes to the source code, but rather to README files, comments or other documents.
  
- _**codestyle**/reformated-feature-name_  :  Represents formatting changes that do not affect the logic of the code. This includes the correction of indentation, the addition or deletion of spaces, or formatting adjustments in the code.
  
- _**refractoring**/modified_structure_  :  Used when you modify the structure of the code without changing its behavior. This is typically done to improve readability, maintainability or code architecture.
  
- _**tests**/[unit , ui]/tested-element_  :  This concerns additions or modifications to tests. This includes writing new tests, modifying existing tests, or correcting tests.
  
- _**chore**/dependancies_  :  Used for changes that do not concern functionality or bug fixes or bug fixes, but are necessary for the project to run smoothly. This may include updates to dependencies, configurations or scripts.
